# calculator
The odin project - Foundations final project

!!!Buttons in gray are not added yet!!!

I did my own solution for the order of calculation, it wasn't asked at all but i liked the challenge.

Things to add: 
- Options menu?
- Color themes
- A memory of the last 5 or 10 calculations
- Modulo (%) and floating point buttons
- Keyboard compatibility
- Readme viewer in page

Maybe i leave it as it's. Incomplete in a way, but i did more than TOP asked for :)
